    # API Guides

    Rithum now supports both dropship and private marketplace integrations.  The following guides will help you get started with each type of integration.

    Note that the guides are written from the perspective of the retailer and supplier, but in many cases the same APIs are used for both.

    Finally, 90% or more of the work to do a dropship integration is the exact same work, meaning the same APIs and the same data,

    as a private marketplace integration.


    **Standard Integration  Guide**


    This guide explains how a retailer or supplier would use the Dsco APIs to integrate to Rithum whether doing a dropship 

    integration or a marketplace integration.  Please read this first before moving to the dropship or marketplace guides.

    Note that most of the work is the same for both types of integrations.

    This guide describes the work that is specific to dropship integrations for retailers and suppliers.

    **Customer Care Integration Guide**


    This guide describes the Customer Care workflow typically used in marketplace relationships

    to allow end consumer feedback to make its way to a supplier for resolution.


    [Customer Care Integration Guide](../guides/customer-care-guide.html)


    **Conversation Integration Guide**


    This guide describes how retailers and suppliers can have direct conversations with each other,

    specifying with precision which order, item, etc. is being discussed.


    [Conversation Integration Guide](../guides/conversation-integration-guide.html)


    **Advanced Catalog Attribution File Format Guide**

    This document delineates the format of the Advanced Catalog Attribution file that can be used

    to define the retailer's catalog structure to Rithum.


    [Advanced Catalog Attribution File Format Guide](../guides/dsco-catalog-attribution-file-format.html)


    **Implementation guide**


    This document outlines best practices for implementing the Dsco V3 APIs as a retailer on the Rithum's Dsco platform.


    [Implementation guide](https://apiv3-test.s3.amazonaws.com/export/Dsco+Retailer+V3+API+Implementation+Guide+2023-09-08.pdf)


    **Shipping Labels Guide**


    This guide describes how connected retailers and suppliers can collaborate to generate shipping labels for orders placed by retailers and shipped by suppliers.


    [Shipping Labels Guide](../guides/shipping-labels-guide.html)

    **V3 - July 20, 2020**


    Rithum released its effort to ensure all documentation is inline with actual APIs to production, including the correction of a few discrepancies documented in the July 8, 2020 release below.



    **V3 - July 8, 2020**


    Rithum has released to its staging environment the result of an effort to confirm that this API documentation is inline with the actual APIs as there have been a few discrepancies.

    There were a few cases where the APIs were returning an object attribute out of line with the docs and instead of just removing the invalidly named attribute, Rithum kept the invalid

    named attribute but as a deprecated property.


    These are the objects/attributes in question...


    * Invoice.lineItems (InvoiceLineItem object)
      * expectedAmount is deprecated in favor of dscoExpectedAmount
      * expectedDifference is deprecated in favor of dscoExpectedDifference

    * Order.lineItems (OrderLineItem object)
      * updateDate is deprecated in favor of activityDate

    * Order.shipping (OrderShipping object)
      * state is deprecated in favor of region

    **V3 - June 17, 2020**


    Rithum has corrected various documentation errors found, including the following...


    * The Catalog object incorrectly documented tradingPartnerId and tradingPartnerName instead of dscoTradingPartnerId and dscoTradingPartnerName

    * The Inventory object incorrectly documented tradingPartnerId and tradingPartnerName instead of dscoTradingPartnerId and dscoTradingPartnerName


    **V3 - June 5, 2020**


    Rithum has corrected various documentation errors found, including the following...

    * The [Create Stream Operation](#operation/createStreamOperation) input params and result were incorrectly documented

    * The [Get Catalog Change Log Operation](#operation/getCatalogChangeLog) docs did not mark startDate/endDate as required

    * The [Get Order Change Log Operation](#operation/getOrderChangeLog) docs did not mark startDate/endDate as required

    * The large batch APIs documented return method has been correctly set to 200 instead of 202 since these are synchronous APIs

    Rithum is rolling out its new V3 APIs as it completes them.  Each API will roll out first to the Dsco

    staging environment and then to the production environment.  The release notes designate what change went where.

    # Authentication

    All APIs require authentication except for the [Get Access Token API](#operation/getAccessToken).  Rithum is transitioning from a simple bearer token to the

    Oauth2 Client Credentials Workflow.  Existing users of the V3 APIs may continue to use the old way,

    DscoAuth, while new customers must use the new way, DscoOauth.


    # Details that Matter


    ## The APIs Will Change

    Rithum reserves the right to add new attributes at any time so partners should ensure their validators won't break should this happen.  Rithum

    will not break backward compatibility, so Rithum will not remove or change the name of an attribute or API.


    ## Error Handling

    The partner should implement an exponential backoff-retry algorithm to retry API calls sent to Rithum that fail when the HTTP Response Type

    indicates the error is a transient error, or one that will go away with time (see list of HTTP codes below).


    Rithum recommends the backoff-retry algorithm retry for up to two hours after which the partner should send a request to Rithum support

    (support-dsco@rithum.com) to ask whether there is an issue with the Dsco APIs.  In the event that this occurs, please send the complete API

    request made and the HTTP error code that is being seen by the partner in the support request.


    Here are some resources describing the algorithms we recommend a partner implement...


    [Retry pattern with exponential backoff](https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-retry-pattern-with-exponential-back)

    [Wikipedia Exponential Backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff)


    ### Retriable Http errors

    * 408 - request timeout

    * 429 - too many requests

    * 500 - internal server error

    * 502 - bad gateway

    * 503 - service unavailable

    * 504 - gateway timeout


    ## Retailer or Supplier

    Are you acting as a Retailer or a Supplier when invoking the Dsco APIs? Your account was assigned either a

    Retailer or Supplier role when it was setup and the required params for the APIs can differ depending on your

    Account Role. It's possible that both a retailer and supplier account were created for you.

    When interacting with the APIs, you will need to use the correct account depending on what you are trying to

    do. A supplier account commonly will want to acknowledge orders, change order statuses, add shipping/tracking

    information to an order, etc. A retailer account will often want to create orders, check on order statuses,

    get order tracking information, etc.


    ## Sync vs Async API Contracts

    ### Synchronous APIs

    Some APIs are synchronous, meaning that the API does not return an HTTP status until the work requested by the API invocation

    has completed.  For example, the synchronous [Add Item to Assortment](#operation/addItemToAssortment) API does not return an

    http  ``201`` response until the assortment sent in the request body has been created.


    ### Asynchronous APIs

    Some APIs are asynchronous,

    meaning that the API will return an HTTP response as soon as the API has safely accepted the work which will be performed

    at some point in the near future.  The [Add Items To Assortment Small Batch](#operation/addItemsToAssortmentSmallBatch) API

    is an example of an async API which returns an HTTP ``202`` response as soon as the work to add the items to the assortment

    has been safely queued up to be done soon.


    ### Eventual Consistency

    Synchronous APIs that create or update data return success as soon as the change has been made in the database.  However,

    there may be a period of time between when a change is made via a synchronous API call and that change is reflected

    across all Rithum systems and APIs.  So, if one were to call the [Get Order Object](#operation/getOrderById) API to retrieve

    an order that was just created by the the [Create Order](#operation/createOrder) API it may not be found for a short period

    of time.  Usually, the propagation delay for change is on the order of seconds.  However, under rare circumstances

    this can spike to some minutes.  The normal flow of data from a retailer to a supplier and then back from a supplier to

    a retailer means that this latency does not affect best practice use cases.  For example, a retailer creates an order, that

    order is propagated across the system and is only then made available to a supplier to be fulfilled and thus calling the

    [Get Order Object](#operation/getOrderById) API will return the order in question to the supplier.  Similarly, as shipments

    are provided by a supplier they are propagated across the system and then made available to a retailer.


    ### Create Order Post Processing

    An order created synchronously may require some post processing on behalf of the retailer before the order is made

    available for a supplier to fulfill.  However, an order in this state is in fact persisted to a database and will be available via the

    [Get Order Object](#operation/getOrderById) API for example once all post processing is completed and the change is propagated

    across the system.

      ### Shelf Life of Missed Channel Overrides

      Missed channel overrides refer to the channel overrides that are not successfully processed or applied by the system due to reasons such as item not existing yet. It is important for retailers to understand the shelf life of these missed channel overrides.


      The shelf life of missed channel overrides is currently set at **60 days**. This means that if a channel override fails to be processed or applied, it will remain in the system for a period of **60 days** before being automatically removed.


      During this shelf life period, the system will automatically try to reapply overwrites as items are created or updated. After the **60-day** shelf life expires, any missed channel overrides that were not successfully processed or applied will be permanently removed from the system.

        The most common use case for this API is to find out whether an async request worked or not. Let's say a call is

        made to the [addItemsToAssortmentSmallBatch](#operation/addItemsToAssortmentSmallBatch) API, which will process

        the request after the fact but immediately returns a requestId.  Use this API and pass in the requestId to get back

        an entry for each assortment item processed in the previous call. If there are no results, wait a while and then

        check back again.


        This is a synchronous paged API.  If the request results are too large to return in a single request,

        the response will include a `scrollId` attribute.  To get the next page of results, simply provide this

        value in the search query.  When an empty page of results is returned, there are no more pages.  The pages of

        results are cached and expire if the next page of results isn't retrieved within the default expire period

        for searches. The default expiry is five minutes.  This value will not change between requests to get pages.  If

        the page doesn't exist - perhaps it expired - the API will return an HTTP 404 error.


        If `scrollId` is provided, then any other provided query parameters will be ignored.

        If `scrollId` is not provided, then either `requestId` is required or `startDate` and `endDate` are required.


        Change logs are meant to give feedback to asynchronous batch calls. As such, they should be called soon

        after making the batch call. It's expected that the change log calls will happen within a few minutes

        (or at most, a few hours) after the call is made so that the caller can determine if there were any issues.


        By default, change logs will stay in our system for two weeks. However, we reserve the right to shorten that time

        on an account by account basis if there are a large number of change logs for an account that would otherwise

        degrade the performance of our systems.

            Note that you must call to get the next page of results within 5 minutes

            of the previous call or you will get an HTTP 404 error when trying to get

            the next page of results.

                          * **pending**: The supplier is in the process of setting up the item within Rithum and it is
                            not ready for its trading partners to sell it.  Rithum will not export this item
                            in inventory update feeds to the supplier’s trading partners, but will export
                            this item in catalog feeds.

                          * **active**: The supplier has completed item setup for this item and trading partners may now
                            sell the item when the item has positive quantity.

                          * **discontinued_sell_through**: The supplier has discontinued the item but wants its trading partners to continue
                            to sell the item until the item's availableQuantity goes to zero.  Rithum will continue
                            to send inventory updates to the supplier’s trading partners if the supplier
                            continues to update the available quantity of the item.  At some point, it is
                            expected that the available quantity will go to zero and remain there.  However,
                            if the supplier should send a positive inventory quantity, it will be passed to its
                            trading partners.

                          * **discontinued**: The item is discontinued and the supplier’s trading partners are not to sell any
                            more.  Rithum will export the item to the supplier’s trading partners via its
                            designated inventory update feed (file/API), setting the item’s quantity
                            to zero and overriding whatever value may be there.  Suppliers may continue to
                            send positive inventory quantity values for the item to Rithum and Rithum will store it,
                            however, Rithum will continue to send zero quantity available to the supplier’s
                            trading partners.

        ### Overview

        Use this asynchronous API to send smaller numbers of catalog objects to be created/updated

        (up to five megabytes) in a single API call.  Data must be sent in [JSON Lines format](https://jsonlines.org).

        The API will receive the catalog objects, return an HTTP 200, and process the catalog objects after the fact.


        Developers should use the streams API

        to retrieve CatalogChangeLog data to determine what happened by using the requestId returned

        from this API as each corresponding entry in the change log will include the requestId.


        ### Deleting attributes

        Many attributes can be deleted from existing items.

        Excepting attributes required by Rithum (e.g. `sku`, `title`, `status`, `product_status`, `description`) 

        and attributes required by Retailer rules, item attributes can be deleted by providing the JSON value `null`.


        **N.B.** The value for deleting an existing attribute is **not the string `"null"`**.

                  The ItemCatalog JSONs object defines an item of the  Dsco
                  system.

                  Rithum expects an ItemCatalog object, defining an item, exists

                  before inventory is provided for the given item.

                          * **pending**: The supplier is in the process of setting up the item within Rithum and it is
                            not ready for its trading partners to sell it.  Rithum will not export this item
                            in inventory update feeds to the supplier’s trading partners, but will export
                            this item in catalog feeds.

                          * **active**: The supplier has completed item setup for this item and trading partners may now
                            sell the item when the item has positive quantity.

                          * **discontinued_sell_through**: The supplier has discontinued the item but wants its trading partners to continue
                            to sell the item until the item's availableQuantity goes to zero.  Rithum will continue
                            to send inventory updates to the supplier’s trading partners if the supplier
                            continues to update the available quantity of the item.  At some point, it is
                            expected that the available quantity will go to zero and remain there.  However,
                            if the supplier should send a positive inventory quantity, it will be passed to its
                            trading partners.

                          * **discontinued**: The item is discontinued and the supplier’s trading partners are not to sell any
                            more.  Rithum will export the item to the supplier’s trading partners via its
                            designated inventory update feed (file/API), setting the item’s quantity
                            to zero and overriding whatever value may be there.  Suppliers may continue to
                            send positive inventory quantity values for the item to Rithum and Rithum will store it,
                            however, Rithum will continue to send zero quantity available to the supplier’s
                            trading partners.

        ### Overview

        Use this asynchronous API to send very large numbers of catalog objects to be created/updated

        (up to two gigabytes) in a single API call.  Data must be sent in [JSON Lines format](https://jsonlines.org).

        The API will receive the catalog objects and process them after the fact.


        Developers should use the streams API

        to retrieve CatalogChangeLog data to determine what happened by using the requestId returned

        from this API as each corresponding entry in the change log will include the requestId.


        ### Sending a Request

        Due to the large amount of data that can be sent, the process of sending the data has two steps:


        1. Call this API to authenticate, and then receive the **destination URL** to make an HTTP PUT request

        1. HTTP PUT content to the **destination URL**, including the data in the 'body' of the request, where each ItemCatalog Object is sent
           as a JSON object followed by a new line character ([see JSON Lines documentation](https://jsonlines.org))

        ### Deleting attributes

        Many attributes can be deleted from existing items.

        Excepting attributes required by Rithum (e.g. `sku`, `title`, `status`, `product_status`, `description`) 

        and attributes required by Retailer rules, item attributes can be deleted by providing the JSON value `null`.


        **N.B.** The value for deleting an existing attribute is **not the string `"null"`**.

      description: >-
        View changes Rithum made to catalog on behalf of trading partners,
        including failed attempts to change catalog.


        The most common use case for this API is to find out whether an async request made to Rithum worked or not.

        Let's say a call is made to the updateCatalogSmallBatch API, which will process the request after the fact but

        return immediately a requestId.  Use this API and pass in the requestId to get back an entry for each catalog

        object processed in the previous call to updateCatalogSmallBatch.  If there are no results, wait a while and

        then check back again.


        This is a synchronous paged API.  If the request results were too large to return for a single request,

        the response will include a `scrollId` attribute.  To get the next page of results, simply provide this

        value in the search query.  When an empty page of results is returned, there are no more pages.  The pages of

        results are cached and expire if the next page of results isn't retrieved within the default expire period

        for searches. The default expiry is five minutes.  This value will not change between requests to get pages.  If

        the page doesn't exist -perhaps it expired - the API will return an HTTP 404 error.


        If `scrollId` is provided, then any other provided query parameters will be ignored.

        Change logs are meant to give feedback to asynchronous batch calls. As such, they should be called soon

        after making the batch call. It's expected that the change log calls will happen within a few minutes

        (or at most, a few hours) after the call is made so that the caller can determine if there were any issues.


        By default, change logs will stay in our system for two weeks. However, we reserve the right to shorten that time

        on an account by account basis if there are a large number of change logs for an account that would otherwise

        degrade the performance of our systems.

        Use this synchronous API to get the active catalog by a retailer's Id. 

        This will get the currently published/activated catalog for the retailer.

        If you do not have permission you will be denied, or if there are no active catalogs, we will let you know in the response.

        If the size of the catalog payload exceeds 6MB then the user will receive a link to the S3 file location for subsequent download.

        If your catalog's size is < 100KB or > 6MB you can use the `isReturnDocumentedStructure=true` queryStringParameter to enforce the proper, documented response.body schema.


        This returns the full nested catalog. To find various categories, you'll need to look in the `children` property.


        I.E. to find `Lawn And Garden||LawnMower||Pushmower`
          * You would look at the top level `children`, find the item with a `Path` of `Lawn and Garden`
          * Then look in its `children`, find the item with a `Path` of `LawnMower`
          * Then look in its `children` and find the item with a `Path` of `Pushmower`

        There is also an attributes property on each level that contains the properties that a supplier should fill out for that category. It will tell you if the attribute is required or recommended or optional.


        This synchronous API is not meant to be used to retrieve lots of objects and as such is rate-limited.

        You can call this API 1 times per second, or up to 3600 times per hour.

        Use this synchronous API to send a named catalog attribution file to
        Rithum,

        (up to two gigabytes) in a single API call, either to create a new named catalog attribution

        revision (draft) or to update an existing catalog attribution revision. The API will receive the uploaded

        catalog attribution data and process it after the fact.


        Please reference the <a href="../guides/dsco-catalog-attribution-file-format.html" target="blank">Dsco Catalog Attribution CSV File Guide</a>

        to understand the format of the file to send to Rithum. Note the catalog attribution file described in the above guide may be gzip compressed

        before being sent to Rithum, dramatically reducing the time necessary to upload the file and improving overall processing time.


        Note that this API currently requires that file be a tsv file (tab delimited), though a JSON format will also be supported.
              
        Due to the large

        amount of data that can be sent, the process of sending the data has two steps:


        1. Call this API to authenticate which then returns the destination URL to PUT the content to and then

        1. PUT content to the destination URL returned in 1 above where the file conforms to the format specified in
          the <a href="../guides/dsco-catalog-attribution-file-format.html" target="blank">Dsco Catalog Attribution CSV File Guide</a>.

        View changes Rithum made on behalf of a retailer, to a catalog taxonomy
        (attribution), including failed attempts.


        The most common use case for this API is to find out whether an async request made to Rithum worked or not.

        Let's say a call is made to the updateCatalogAttributionLargeBatch API; this will be processed in the background but shall

        return a request requestId immediately.. Use this API and pass in the requestId to get back a log of all changes made associated

        with a specific requestId.


        This is a synchronous paged API.  If the request results were too large to return for a single request,

        the response will include a `scrollId` attribute.  To get the next page of results, simply provide this

        value in the search query.  When an empty page of results is returned, there are no more pages.  The pages of

        results are cached and expire if the next page of results isn't retrieved within the default expire period

        for searches. The default expiry is five minutes.  This value will not change between requests to get pages.  If

        the page doesn't exist -perhaps it expired - the API will return an HTTP 404 error.


        If `scrollId` is provided, then any other provided query parameters will be ignored.

        If `scrollId` is not provided, then either `requestId` is required or `startDate` and `endDate` are required.


        Change logs are meant to give feedback to asynchronous batch calls. As such, they should be called soon

        after making the batch call. It's expected that the change log calls will happen within a few minutes

        (or at most, a few hours) after the call is made so that the caller can determine if there were any issues.


        By default, change logs will stay in our system for two weeks. However, we reserve the right to shorten that time

        on an account by account basis if there are a large number of change logs for an account that would otherwise

        degrade the performance of our systems.

      summary: Update Channel Overrides Small Batch
      description: >-
        
        ### Overview

        Channel overrides allow retailers to augment or override item catalog data provided by suppliers 

        so that this retailer-provided data is present when items flow from suppliers to their retailer via APIs or streams.  

        Today, this channel override data is not supported for retailers using file automation to get item data.


        Rithum provides two methods for sending channel override updates: Small and Large.

        Use this asynchronous API to send small numbers of channel overrides (up to five megabytes worth) in a single API call.

        To send a larger update, use [Update Channel Overrides Large Batch](#operation/updateChannelOverridesBatchLarge).

        The API will return an HTTP response immediately, and process the channel overrides after the fact.


        ### Schema & Requirements

        The *API Update Channel Overrides Small Batch* accepts JSON formatted data containing an array of channel override objects.


        A channel override has two parts; both parts are required for a channel override to be valid.

        * An Item Selector.

        * A collection of overrides, called `replacements`.


        An Item selector must have two pieces of information:

        - An identifier for the trading partner supplier of the item. This can be either the `tradingPartnerId` or the `tradingPartnerName` of the trading partner. 
          You can find this information on your account trading partner page.
        - An identifier for the item. This can be any value from this list: `ean`, `gtin`, `isbn`, `mpn`, `sku`, `retailerSku`, or `upc`.
          The `sku` is the SKU identifier used by the supplier in their system. `retailerSku` is the SKU identifier used by the retailer, sometimes called the "Partner SKU".

        By providing both of these pieces of information, you create an unambiguous combination of data.

        It is possible to use more than these two pieces of information if you wish to be more specific with your Item Selector, though it is not required.

        If you provide more than one **Item identifier**, then ALL of the **Item identifiers** must match for an Item to be selected.


        * For example, if you provide `ean` and `sku`, then the target Item MUST match both values in order to be selected.


        In the second part, there must be an object that defines the override data. Please use this for each attribute...


        - `replacements`:  This is the retailer-provided data that will augment/override data on a supplier's item.

        This must be provided and must have at least one element in it for the API call to be valid.

        - `replacements.partnerSku`: Retailers may provide a unique identifier for an item.

        This will be copied to the attribute `item.partnerSku` for backward compatibility.

        - `replacements.listingStatus`: Retailers may provide this status flag to indicate whether the item is listed on the Retailer's site.

        This can then be used in the web application to filter and find items that are and are not listed.

        - `replacements.retailModels`: Retailers may provide a comma-separated list of the pricing models that they support for this item. Can be `dropship`, `marketplace` or both.

        - `replacements.activeRetailModel`: Retailers can specify the retail model they expect to use for transactions involving this item. Can be `dropship` or `marketplace`.

        - `replacements.retailPrice`: Retailers may include a retail price for an item.

        - `replacements.taxCode`: Retailers may provide a tax code for this item.

        - `replacements.commissionPercentage`: Retailers may provide a marketplace commission percentage for this item.


        ### Deleting attribute overrides

        Setting the value for any attribute override to `null` will delete the existing value for that attribute override.

        Note well, that this is the JSON value `null`, not the string `"null"`.


        In the following example would delete an override set for `retailPrice` and `partnerSku`:

        ```json

        {
          "tradingPartnerId": "321654",
          "ean": "0674758697076",
          "replacements": {
            "partnerSku": null,
            "retailPrice": null
          }
        }

        ```

        ### Change Logs

        Developers may call the [Get Channel Override Change Log API](#operation/getChannelOverridesChangeLog)

        to query process states (`succeeded`, `failed`, `pending`) by passing the `requestId` returned from this API.

                          This feature is in a beta state; please reach out if you wish to test this feature.


                          This feature allows a retailer to override values presented from a supplier by passing in the expected structure.

                          The structure is a partial item including only the values you wish to override.


                          Please only put in values that are different from existing values and make sure they match your catalog taxonomy:


                          You will receive an error if you try to override any of these values, as they are either owned by a supplier or internally:

                              * **pending**: The supplier is in the process of setting up the item within Rithum and it is
                                not ready for its trading partners to sell it.  Rithum will not export this item
                                in inventory update feeds to the supplier’s trading partners, but will export
                                this item in catalog feeds.

                              * **active**: The supplier has completed item setup for this item and trading partners may now
                                sell the item when the item has positive quantity.

                              * **discontinued_sell_through**: The supplier has discontinued the item but wants its trading partners to continue
                                to sell the item until the item's availableQuantity goes to zero.  Rithum will continue
                                to send inventory updates to the supplier’s trading partners if the supplier
                                continues to update the available quantity of the item.  At some point, it is
                                expected that the available quantity will go to zero and remain there.  However,
                                if the supplier should send a positive inventory quantity, it will be passed to its
                                trading partners.

                              * **discontinued**: The item is discontinued and the supplier’s trading partners are not to sell any
                                more.  Rithum will export the item to the supplier’s trading partners via its
                                designated inventory update feed (file/API), setting the item’s quantity
                                to zero and overriding whatever value may be there.  Suppliers may continue to
                                send positive inventory quantity values for the item to Rithum and Rithum will store it,
                                however, Rithum will continue to send zero quantity available to the supplier’s
                                trading partners.

                                Each entry in this object is a key/value that defines an extended attribute. For example, assume

                                an item exists just for the retailer whose Dsco Account ID is 12345678 and should include a size attribute and a color attribute.

                                ```

                                Note the names and datatypes of the key/value pairs that may be required by a specific retailer will be part of that retailer's Catalog Attributions definitions.

      summary: Update Channel Overrides Large Batch
      description: >-
        
        ### Overview

        Channel overrides allow retailers to augment or override supplier-provided Catalog data, 

        ensuring the data's presence and flow between partners via APIs or streams. 

        Channel override data is not currently supported for retailers using file automation to receive item data.


        Rithum provides two methods for sending channel override updates: **Small** and **Large**.

        Use this asynchronous API to send very large numbers of channel overrides to be created (up to two gigabytes) in a single API call. 

        To send a smaller update using JSON, you can use [Update Channel Overrides Small Batch](#operation/updateChannelOverridesBatchSmall).


        ### Calling the API

        Due to the large amount of data that can be sent, the process of sending the data has two steps:


        1. Call this API with authentication.  No data is required in the `body` of the request.  <br/>In the response, find:
            1. the destination URL, contained in property `dataUrl`. 
            1. the request identifier, contained in property `requestId`
        1. Send the Excel file containing channel overrides via HTTP PUT request to the destination URL returned in step 1 via property `dataUrl`.


        When making the PUT request using the value in `dataUrl`, set the header `Content-Type` to value "**application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet**".

        After transferring the file using the destination URL, the API will return an HTTP response immediately, and process the file after the response is sent.


        Track the progress of the channel overrides using the [channel overrides change log API](#operation/getChannelOverridesChangeLog).

        ### Schema & Requirements

        Row 1 of the Excel spreadsheet contains field names as column headers. Subsequent rows contain data.


        These are the fields that are supported:

        * `dscoTradingPartnerId`

        * `dscoTradingPartnerName`

        * `ean`

        * `gtin`

        * `isbn`

        * `mpn`

        * `sku`

        * `retailerSku`

        * `upc`

        * `listingStatus`

        * `channelSku`

        * `retailModels`

        * `activeRetailModel`

        * `retailPrice`

        * `taxCode`

        * `commissionPercentage`


        To identify a target Item, provide:

        * An identifier for the trading partner supplier of the item. This can be either the `tradingPartnerId` or the `tradingPartnerName` of the trading partner. 
          You can find this information on your account trading partner page.
        * An identifier for the item. This can be any value from this list: `ean`, `gtin`, `isbn`, `mpn`, `sku`, `retailerSku`, or `upc`.
          The `sku` is the SKU identifier used by the supplier in their system. `retailerSku` is the SKU identifier used by the retailer, sometimes called the "Partner SKU".

        By providing both of these pieces of information, you create an unambiguous combination of data.

        It is possible to use more than these two pieces of information if you wish to be more specific with your Item Selector, though it is not required.

        If you provide more than one **Item identifier**, then ALL of the **Item identifiers** must match for an Item to be selected.


        * For example, if you provide `ean` and `sku`, then the target Item MUST match both values in order to be selected.


        To specify an attribute override, provide any of these:

        * `channelSku`: Retailers may provide a unique identifier for an item. This will be copied to the attribute `item.partnerSku` for backward compatibility.

        * `listingStatus`: Retailers may provide this status flag to indicate whether the item is listed on the Retailer's site. 

        This can then be used in the web application to filter and find items that are and are not listed.

        * `retailModels`: Retailers may provide a comma-separated list of the pricing models that they support for this item. Can be `dropship`, `marketplace` or both.

        * `activeRetailModel`: Retailers can specify the retail model they expect to use for transactions involving this item. Can be `dropship` or `marketplace`

        * `retailPrice`: Retailers may include a retail price for an item.

        * `taxCode`: Retailers may provide a tax code for this item.

        * `commissionPercentage`: Retailers may provide a marketplace commission percentage for this item.



        At least one attribute override is required.


        ### Deleting attribute overrides

        Setting the value for any attribute override to the string `null` will delete any existng value for that attribute override.


        ### Change Log

        Following a call to Update Channel Overrides (Either Large Batch or [Small Batch](#operation/updateChannelOverridesBatchSmall)), developers may call the [Get Channel Override Change Log API](#operation/getChannelOverridesChangeLog) to query process states (succeeded, failed, pending) by passing the `requestId` returned from this API.

      summary: Get Channel Override Change Log
      description: >-
        View changes Rithum made when processing channel overrides.


        To use this API, pass in the `requestId` to receive an entry for each channel override object processed 

        in the previous call to [Update Channel Overrides Large Batch](#operation/updateChannelOverridesBatchLarge) 

        or to [Update Channel Overrides Small Batch](#operation/updateChannelOverridesBatchSmall).

        If there are no results, wait a while and then check back again.


        To get logs for a previous request, send the value for `requestId` that came from the response to that request.

        To get logs for a given period of time, regardless of request, send values for `startDate` and `endDate`.


        This is a synchronous paged API.  If the request results were too large to return for a single request,

        the response will include a `scrollId` attribute.  To get the next page of results, simply provide this

        value in the search query.  When an empty page of results is returned, there are no more request results.  


        The pages of results are cached and expire if the next page of results isn't retrieved within the default expire period

        for searches. The default expiration is five minutes.  This value will not change between requests to get pages.  If

        the page requested has expired, the API will return an error (HTTP 404).


        If `scrollId` is provided, then *any other provided query parameters will be ignored*.

        If `scrollId` is not provided, then either `requestId` is required or `startDate` and `endDate` are required.

        Change logs are meant to give feedback to asynchronous batch calls. As such, they should be called soon

        after making the batch call. It's expected that the change log calls will happen within a few minutes

        (or at most, a few hours) after the call is made so that the caller can determine if there were any issues.


        By default, change logs will stay in our system for two weeks. However, we reserve the right to shorten that time

        on an account by account basis if there are a large number of change logs for an account that would otherwise

        degrade the performance of our systems.

        3. Otherwise, the date fields will be used. Orders may be searched bounded by a start and end date. Either

        `ordersCreatedSince` or `ordersUpdatedSince` must be provided. `until` is also required.


        The `status` and `includeTestOrders` parameters apply to the search regardless of whether the search is using

        `consumerOrderNumber` or date fields.

        View changes Rithum made to orders on behalf of trading partners,

        The most common use case for this API is to find out whether an async request made to Rithum worked or not.

        Let's say a call is made to the createOrderSmallBatch API, which will process the request after the fact but

        return immediately a requestId.  Use this API and pass in the requestId to get back an entry for each order

        object processed in the previous call to createOrderSmallBatch.  If there are no results, wait a while and

        then check back again.


        This is a synchronous paged API.  If the request results were too large to return for a single request,

        the response will include a `scrollId` attribute.  To get the next page of results, simply provide this

        value in the search query.  When an empty page of results is returned, there are no more pages.  The pages of

        results are cached and expire if the next page of results isn't retrieved within the default expire period

        for searches. The default expiry is five minutes.  This value will not change between requests to get pages.  If

        the page doesn't exist -perhaps it expired - the API will return an HTTP 404 error.


        If `scrollId` is provided, then any other provided query parameters will be ignored.

        If `scrollId` is not provided, then either `requestId` is required or `startDate` and `endDate` are required.


        Change logs are meant to give feedback to asynchronous batch calls. As such, they should be called soon

        after making the batch call. It's expected that the change log calls will happen within a few minutes

        (or at most, a few hours) after the call is made so that the caller can determine if there were any issues.


        By default, change logs will stay in our system for two weeks. However, we reserve the right to shorten that time

        on an account by account basis if there are a large number of change logs for an account that would otherwise

        degrade the performance of our systems.

        This synchronous API is not meant to be used to retrieve lots of ItemInventory objects and as such is rate-limited.

        You can call this API 15 times per second, or up to 300 times per minute.


        The streams are for day-to-day automated retrievals of orders, invoices, inventory, etc.

      description: >-
        View changes Rithum made to inventory on behalf of trading partners,
        including failed attempts to change inventory.


        The most common use case for this API is to find out whether an async request made to Rithum worked or not.

        Let's say a call is made to the updateInventorySmallBatch API, which will process the request after the fact but

        return immediately a requestId.  Use this API and pass in the requestId to get back an entry for each inventory

        object processed in the previous call to updateInventorySmallBatch.  If there are no results, wait a while and

        then check back again.


        This is a synchronous paged API.  If the request results were too large to return for a single request,

        the response will include a `scrollId` attribute.  To get the next page of results, simply provide this

        value in the search query.  When an empty page of results is returned, there are no more pages.  The pages of

        results are cached and expire if the next page of results isn't retrieved within the default expire period

        for searches. The default expiry is five minutes.  This value will not change between requests to get pages.  If

        the page doesn't exist -perhaps it expired - the API will return an HTTP 404 error.


        If `scrollId` is provided, then any other provided query parameters will be ignored.

        If `scrollId` is not provided, then either `requestId` is required or `startDate` and `endDate` are required.


        Change logs are meant to give feedback to asynchronous batch calls. As such, they should be called soon

        after making the batch call. It's expected that the change log calls will happen within a few minutes

        (or at most, a few hours) after the call is made so that the caller can determine if there were any issues.


        By default, change logs will stay in our system for two weeks. However, we reserve the right to shorten that time

        on an account by account basis if there are a large number of change logs for an account that would otherwise

        degrade the performance of our systems.

            Note that you must call to get the next page of results within 5 minutes

            of the previous call or you will get an HTTP 404 error when trying to get

        Rithum requires that each item include a status and a quantity.  By quantity either the

        Use this asynchronous API to send very large amounts of inventory update
        objects (up to two gigabytes) in a

        single API call. The API will receive the inventory updates and process them after the fact.


        Developers should use the streams API to retrieve InventoryChangeLog data to determine what happened by

        using the requestId returned from this API as each corresponding entry in the change log will include the requestId.


        Due to the large amount of data that can be sent, the process of sending the data has two steps:


        1. Call this API to authenticate which then returns the destination URL to PUT the content to and then

        1. PUT content to the destination URL returned in 1 above where each ItemInventory JSON Object is sent
           as a JSON object followed by a new line character ([see JSON Lines documentation](http://jsonlines.org))

        Rithum requires that each ItemInventory object include the following:

        * sku

        * quantityAvailable - must be correct sum of quantities in warehouses(s)

        * warehouses[].quantity - there must be at least one warehouse in the array with quantity specified


        For an exact definition of the ItemInventory object, please reference the response type of the

        [Get Inventory By Id API](#operation/getInventoryById) which is the ItemInventory object.


        Use the [Inventory Change Log API](#operation/getInventoryChangeLog) to determine the success

        or failure of individual inventory objects since the inventory JSON lines are processed

        asynchronously after the fact.


        Below is a sample inventory file.  Note that each line is a complete ItemInventory JSON

        object separated by a new line character as in \n.


        This example isn't complete because the objects in the file aren't valid but the example

        shows what is meant by json objects separated by new line characters in the file.  Notice

        the example includes a valid json object followed by a newline character (the newline

        character is represented by "\n" to illustrate the point) on each line of the file.


        ```

        { }\n

        { }\n

        { }\n

        ```


        The below example is a complete, accurate JSON lines Item Inventory file as expected.


        ```

        Suppliers should use this asynchronous API to acknowledge one or more
        orders. Supplier's are expected to

        acknowledge receipt of orders by calling this API which accepts a list of mappings from IDs

        to the type of ID passed in.  Additionally, suppliers may pass in supplierOrderNumber

        to store this value on the order as part of acknowledging the order.


        This API is not meant to be used to acknowledge lots of Order objects and as such is rate-limited.

        You can call this API 15 times per second, or up to 1000 times per minute.


        This API will asynchronously acknowledge the orders after the fact.

        The API may be sent up to 5 megabytes of data in the body of the request.


        Developers may call the OrderChangeLog API to determine what happened, passing in the requestId returned

        from this API to query for whether the individual objects of this call were successfully

        processed or not.

      summary: Create Stream
      description: >-
        Use this synchronous API to create a stream.  A stream is a sequential
        list of events for a specific object type,

        specified using the Stream.objectType attribute.  An optional query may also be included, via the

        Stream.query attribute, that filters the objects further.


        Streams are partitioned into groups of stream events by a key, allowing for clients to parallelize

        retrieving data from a stream safely by partition.  All streams have one partition by default.


        There is a hard limit of 20 partitions on a single stream.  In practice, some of the highest volume streams only 

        require 8 partitions for customers to read and keep up.  If a customer feels it needs more than 8 partitions, 

        please reach out to support with a request to increase the limit and the reason why it is believed necessary.


        Developers should use the stream APIs as the fundamental method of getting

        data out of Dsco. The streams are for day-to-day automated retrievals of orders, invoices, inventory, etc. 


        Here are some foundational use cases that illustrate how to use streams.


        **Get all object changes as they occur**

        1. Create a stream with some attributes...
           1. Let's say we set objectType to *inventory*
           1. We set description to *inventory changes*
        1. Our returned object will include the *id* of the newly created stream

        1. Start by calling the [List Streams API](#operation/listStreams) passing in the ID of the stream in question
           to get the stream object which will include the stream's current position value
        1. We then begin micro-polling, let's say every 60 seconds, to get new objects
           that appear in the stream by calling the [Get Stream Events from Position API](#operation/getStreamEventsFromPosition),
           passing in the position pulled down from Dsco, which is the starting position to read from
           1. At the top of the loop, we make the call to [Get Stream Events from Position API](#operation/getStreamEventsFromPosition) to get events
           1. We process each event in turn, and as we go through the loop we see how much time has gone by and
              if 5 seconds has gone by, we make a call to the
              [Update Stream Position API](#operation/updateStreamPosition) to acknowledge
              receipt of these events
           1. As we process events, we make sure to handle any errors that may occur so our loop doesn't end
              prematurely; in the error handler for an error, let's say the back office system you are pushing
              these events to is down, you have two strategies you may employ...
              1. You may simply end processing in the loop, first calling the [Update Stream Position API](#operation/updateStreamPosition)
                 to ensure the last successfully processed event before the one that failed, if any, gets
                 marked successful in Rithum's stream, and then wait for the next run of your application
                 to see if the resource has come back up
              1. If the error is specific to the one event, let's say there's an attribute value that's
                 breaking your logic in one event, you can store the one event to be handled on your side
                 later that someone will need to look at and keep processing events in the stream
           1. At the bottom of the loop where we process the event we note the EventStream.id of
              the last event processed so that at the top of the loop where we make a call to Rithum to see
              if there are more events to be retrieved, we can pass in the exact position to retrieve more
              events from
           1. The developer's code keeps calling until there are no more events returned and then
              goes to sleep for 60 seconds and then wakes up and does the whole thing again

        **Updating the current position in the stream**

        We need to call the [Update Stream Position API](#operation/updateStreamPosition) to acknowledge that we got StreamEvents

        from the stream so the stream knows how far we've safely read to in case the developer's

        app crashes or something; we can either do this after we process each and every object or

        we can do this after a certain number of objects are read or after a certain amount of time

        goes by or some combination of these strategies; which strategy should you use...


        * **Never Re-process an Event Strategy** If it is catastrophic to your business if you should re-process an event

        in the rare occurrence of recovering from a failure then you should call the Update Stream Position

        after each and every StreamEvent you process by passing in the *id* of the StreamEvent just processed

        * **Allow possibility of Re-process Event Strategy** If it's OK that under the rare occurrence of recovering
          from failure that you reprocess some events, then it's far more performant for you and for us if you
          only call the Update Stream Position after a period of time or after a certain number of events; the
          greater the duration between updates to the position the greater the possibility that if a failure occurred at the worst
          point in time, that a larger number of events might get re-processed; Rithum recommends a position update
          every five seconds under most circumstances

        **Recover from failure**

        If your app crashes that is pulling objects from the stream, simply restart it.  Your app will start by

        once again calling the [List Streams API](#operation/listStreams) to get the current position

        from the stream and then use

        it to call Get Stream Events, passing in the stream id and the current position.  You're off and running.

        Note above regarding strategies for whether it's OK to re-process events or not.


        **Go back in time to recover from failure**

        Once you have created a stream, you may call Get Stream Events in as many applications as you want to

        pull down from different points in the stream, simultaneously.  However, there is only one position

        in a stream marking where you've read from.  So how does this work?  It works because there are two

        variants of the Get Stream Events APIs.


        The first variant, called [Get Stream Events from Position API](#operation/getStreamEventsFromPosition),

        simply returns events from the position

        value you pass in and then as you get events, you acknowledge them and update the position.


        The second variant, called [Get Stream Events in Range API](#operation/getStreamEventsInRange),

        allows you to pass in a starting position value and

        and an ending position value to bound the events to be returned from the call to only those in that range.

        In this case, you will not call update position as you go, you simply keep reading until there are no more

        events returned and then you're done.  Note that this will have no impact on another application that is

        simultaneously pulling down new events as they occur at the tip of the stream based on the position.


        So, let's say you had an upstream system that you were pushing events too that was down for an hour yesterday

        and no one knew about it and all along your code has been updating the position of the stream.  Well, you

        let the code that is reading from and processing events at the tip of the stream keep running and you spin up

        an application whose purpose is to recover from failure and you pass into that app the bounding range of events

        that you want and you let it run until it processes all the events.  When it's done, you will get no more events

        from Rithum and so you will know the app can shut down.


        What if you don't know the exact id of the two events that bounded your one hour outage?  No problem, you can

        pass in a standard ISO 8601 timestamp that bounds it.  NOTE!!! More than one event could have occurred at the

        same millisecond and so unless you have the exact id of the two StreamEvent objects that bounded your outage

        then it's possible you will re-process some StreamEvents you already processed.  How many?  Well, it depends on

        how many events exist at that exact moment in time you are passing in as the position.  If it's critical that

        you never re-process events then you will need to do your own bookkeeping to allow you to go back to the level

        of precision you need to recover from failure.

                    If sync, all objects of the underlying stream type, inventory or catalog,

                    will be pulled from Rithum's transaction database and will be dumped into the given stream.  This operation is used

                    to faciliate true-up of all data of a given type.  Currently, this operation may only be used on inventory and catalog streams.


                    If setpartitionowner, sets the partition owner string value.


                    If repartition, Rithum expects that you have previously changed the number of partitions and are calling this to cause the new

                    partitions count to be enforced, rebalancing objects across the remaining partitions.

      summary: Collect Data
      description: >-
        This asynchronous API allows a Rithum partner to send content of any
        kind, JSON in any format, XML in any format,

        to Rithum as a string and then have a partner-provided Node JS script take that string and convert it into the Rithum

        objectType specified.  This API is asynchronous, it returns as soon as it gets the request and processes it after

        the fact.


        Why take this approach?  Rithum wants to allow partners to translate content from their own formats into Rithum's as the

        data comes into Rithum.  However, Rithum knows that the real battle with data formats is not the initial translation

        effort, it's dealing with the inevitable changes that may one day be made by the partner to its own format,

        requiring maintenance of the mapping.  Rithum puts the partner in the driver seat for maintaining their own

        translation by allowing the partner to provide Node JS code that the partner will create and should maintain going

        forward.  See the [Create Function API](#operation/createFunction) for documentation on Functions.

        The partner's Node JS code provided for the "function" should not include any libraries. Attempts to do so will

        exported function...


        | Variable | Type | Description |

        | -- | -- | -- |

        | data | string | the raw data the function will translate from the partner's data format to Dsco's format |

        | context | object | The context in which the function will execute |

        | console | object | Allows for debugging with console.log |

        | module | object | Used to enable exporting the function with module.exports |


        *Function Contract*


        The code for a translate_data function

        should export a single function with this signature...


        function(): Promise<object>


        *Returns*


        Immediately return a standard Node promise object that should be completed later with an object

        of type ResultObject.


        *ResultObject*


        | Attribute | Type | Required |  Description |

        | -- | -- | -- | -- |

        | dscoObjects | DscoObject[] | no | This is an array of `objectType` objects (catalog, shipment, invoice, etc).  This and the errors may both be populated assuming some objects succeeded and some failed. |

        | errors | FunctionError[] | no | This is an array of FunctionError objects.  This and the dscoObjects array may both be populated assuming some objects succeeded and some failed. |


        *FunctionError*


        | Attribute | Type | Required |  Description |

        | -- | -- | -- | -- |

        | errorCode | string | yes | An arbitrary code set by the creator of the Node function. |

        | severity | string | yes | This will be provided back in the function log to find which translations succeed/fail and to help with debugging. |

        | errorDescription | string | no | A human readable description. |

        | payload | any | no | Use this to designate what failed to parse/translate/etc. |

      description: >-
        View changes Rithum made to invoices on behalf of trading partners,
        including failed attempts to change invoices.


        The most common use case for this API is to find out whether an async request made to Rithum worked or not.

        Let's say a call is made to the createInvoiceSmallBatch API, which will process the request after the fact but

        return immediately a requestId.  Use this API and pass in the requestId to get back an entry for each invoice

        object processed in the previous call to createInvoiceSmallBatch.  If there are no results, wait a while and

        then check back again.


        This is a synchronous paged API.  If the request results were too large to return for a single request,

        the response will include a `scrollId` attribute.  To get the next page of results, simply provide this

        value in the search query.  When an empty page of results is returned, there are no more pages.  The pages of

        results are cached and expire if the next page of results isn't retrieved within the default expire period

        for searches. The default expiry is five minutes.  This value will not change between requests to get pages.  If

        the page doesn't exist -perhaps it expired - the API will return an HTTP 404 error.


        If `scrollId` is provided, then any other provided query parameters will be ignored.

        If `scrollId` is not provided, then either `requestId` is required or `startDate` and `endDate` are required.


        Change logs are meant to give feedback to asynchronous batch calls. As such, they should be called soon

        after making the batch call. It's expected that the change log calls will happen within a few minutes

        (or at most, a few hours) after the call is made so that the caller can determine if there were any issues.


        By default, change logs will stay in our system for two weeks. However, we reserve the right to shorten that time

        on an account by account basis if there are a large number of change logs for an account that would otherwise

        degrade the performance of our systems.

            the next page of results.

        ### Protecting Dsco's Platform APIs


        Dsco's platform APIs (production: `https://api.dsco.io/api/v3`

        and staging: `https://staging-api.dsco.io/api/v3`) all require that HTTP requests made

        to these platform APIs include a bearer access token in the Authorization header as in...


        ```

        Authorization: bearer 222222-22222-2222-2222-222222222

        ```


        This API exists to allow an authorized Rithum partner to create a temporary access token, use it

        until it expires, and then call back into this API to get another access token.  This approach

        is known as the OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow.


        Here's exactly how it works.


        ### Creating new API credentials


        Please refer to our <a href="https://knowledge.rithum.com/s/article/Creating-new-API-credentials" target="blank">knowledge article</a> to better understand how to do that yourself independently.


        ### Dynamically Retrieve Access Token


        The Rithum partner should call this API (getAccessToken), using the clientId and clientSecret obtained previously,

        to get a new access token.  The response from this API (getAccessToken) will include both the access token

        and when the token will expire.


        Rithum partners will use the access token, passing it in to Dsco platform APIs as Authorization header

        (see above) to prove they are legit and are authorized to call the API in the request .


        Rithum partners will need to call this API again (getAccessToken) at some point and get

        another access token since each token will eventually expire.  The partner may either wait until they get

        an HTTP 401 response once the access token has in fact expired and then call back here to get a new access

        token or the Rithum partner may proactively get one just before the previous one expires.  To be clear, it's OK

        to have multiple access tokens that are valid at the same time for the same clientId and clientSecret.  This can

        also be useful in a multi-threaded environment where different threads of execution need to manage their own

        access tokens, reaching out to get new ones using the same client credentials simultaneous to other threads

        doing the same.


        Note that the grant_type, client_id and client_secret parameters are sent as form encoded params in the body.


        Here's an exact example of a request/response over the wire...

        ```

        Do a search by one of these...


        * Developers may search for a single return using returnIdType/returnIdValue and if returnIdType is

        'partnerReturnNumber' then accountIdType/accountIdValue must be present so Rithum can find which trading partner

        you want us to search for the return number within, unless scrollId is provided


        * Developers may search for returns using orderIdType/orderIdValue and if orderIdType is

        'poNumber' and the caller is a supplier then accountIdType/accountIdValue must be present so Rithum can find which retailer

        to search for the poNumber within (as usual, if scrollId is provided these won't be there)


        * Developers may search for returns in a date range by those that were created or updated in the period
          using either returnsCreatedSince/until or returnsUpdatedSince/until

        Developers may filter returns returned by this API to only those with a specific status using the status array param.

        This is a synchronous paged API.  If the request results were too large to return in a single request,

        the response will include a "scrollId" attribute.


        To get the next page of results, simply provide this

        value in the search query.  When an empty page of results is returned, you know

        page of results isn't retrieved within the default expire period for searches.


        Unless otherwise specified by the search API itself, the default expiry is

        five minutes.  This value will not change between requests to get pages.  If

        the page doesn't exist, perhaps it expired, the API will return an HTTP 404 error.


        If scrollId is provided, then any other provided query parameters will be ignored.

        View changes Rithum made to returns on behalf of trading partners,
        including failed attempts to change returns.


        The most common use case for this API is to find out whether an async request made to Rithum worked or not.

        Let's say a call is made to the createOrCompleteReturnLargeBatch API, which will process the request after the fact but

        return immediately a requestId.  Use this API and pass in the requestId to get back an entry for each return

        object processed in the previous call to createOrCompleteReturnLargeBatch.  If there are no results, wait a while and

        then check back again.


        This is a synchronous paged API.  If the request results were too large to return for a single request,

        the response will include a `scrollId` attribute.  To get the next page of results, simply provide this

        value in the search query.  When an empty page of results is returned, there are no more pages.  The pages of

        results are cached and expire if the next page of results isn't retrieved within the default expire period

        for searches. The default expiry is five minutes.  This value will not change between requests to get pages.  If

        the page doesn't exist -perhaps it expired - the API will return an HTTP 404 error.


        If `scrollId` is provided, then any other provided query parameters will be ignored.

        If `scrollId` is not provided, then either `requestId` is required or `startDate` and `endDate` are required.


        Change logs are meant to give feedback to asynchronous batch calls. As such, they should be called soon

        after making the batch call. It's expected that the change log calls will happen within a few minutes

        (or at most, a few hours) after the call is made so that the caller can determine if there were any issues.


        By default, change logs will stay in our system for two weeks. However, we reserve the right to shorten that time

        on an account by account basis if there are a large number of change logs for an account that would otherwise

        degrade the performance of our systems.

        This API is not meant to be used to retrieve lots of Warehouse objects and as such is rate-limited.


        If scrollId is provided, then any other provided query parameters will be ignored.

            If the results were too large to return in a single request, this
            attribute

            will contain a value.  To get the next page of results, simply provide this 

            value.  The pages of results are cached and expire if the next

            page of results isn't retrieved within the default expire period for searches.  

            Unless otherwise specified by the search API itself, the default expiry is

            five minutes.  This value will not change between requests to get pages.  If

            the page doesn't exist, perhaps it expired, the API will return an HTTP 404 error.

      summary: Create Conversation
      description: >-
        Use this synchronous API to create a single conversation.  This API will
        always create the conversation synchronously,

        returning an HTTP 201 to indicate that the conversation was created. The conversation will not be available via the 

        Get Conversations API until all post-processing has completed.


        [See the Conversation Integration Guide for more details.](../guides/conversation-integration-guide.html)


        Conversations allow a single retailer or a single supplier to send messages to each other.  Either a retailer

        or a supplier may initiate a conversation with one of its trading partners.


        Conversations group messages together that, usually around the context of something that is the topic of the

        conversation like an order or an invoice or an item being setup and so forth.  As such, each 

        conversation has a `context` that marks what the conversation is about.


        * AccountContext: these are conversation threads that are direct messages back and forth between two trading
          partners without any additional context
        * OrderContext: these are conversation threads that are about a specific order object

        * CatalogContext: these are conversation threads that are about a specific item catalog object, an item being setup or its attributes

        * InventoryContext: these are conversation threads that are about a specific item inventory object

        * ContractContext: these are conversation threads that are about a specific contract object

        * InvoiceContext: these are conversation threads that are about a specific invoice object

        * ReturnContext: these are conversation threads that are about a specific return object


        In addition to the context, each conversation has a `type` that marks what kind of conversation it is.

        * Standard: these are normal conversations between a retailer and a supplier

        * Customer Care: These are conversations between a retailer and a supplier that are about a customer care issue
          that the retailer is trying to resolve with the supplier on behalf of the end consumer.  
          Retailers create a message of type `message_from_consumer` and suppliers respond with messages of type
          `response_to_consumer`.  These conversations are expected to be responded to within the SLA response time agreed upon
          between the retailer and supplier. When a retailer creates a conversation with a type of `customer_care` the retailer
          is expected to provide a `consumer_id` which uniquely identifies the end consumer.

          Messages that are added to a customer care conversation are tagged to indicate that either the message is one that
          came directly from an end consumer or a message a supplier is intending be sent directly to the end
          consumer (see the type attribute of a message and `message_from_consumer`/`response_to_consumer`).

                            However, depending on your integration and use case, you may also need to provide lineNumber or consumerLineNumber.

        Use this synchronous API to retrieve conversation messages.  You can
        call this API up to 5 times per second.


        [See the Conversation Integration Guide for more details.](../guides/conversation-integration-guide.html)


        Note this is a POST not a GET so complex params can be sent as a JSON object as the body of the request.

        This pattern is used from time to time to accommodate complex query parameters.


        If a response includes a scrollId param, there may be another page of results and you will need to call back

        in, including the scrollId attribute in the JSON object passed in as the body of the call.  In this case, 

        all other attributes in the body object will be ignored and the next page of results, if any, will be returned.

        It is possible that you will get back an empty array on the last page of results.  If this happens,

        this means there are no more results.

        First, note that this method is about to be replaced by the oauth2
        security method below.  Existing customers

        will be given two years to transition to the new oauth2 security schema documented below.


        You will be provided an OAuth security token, also called an API Key, which will need to accompany each

        API call as an http header. Make sure you have one for your account. If you don't have one, please email

        Rithum at support-dsco@rithum.com and title your email, "Need Oauth Token". Make sure to include the name of your

        organization and your account information in the body of the email.  The [Getting Started section](#section/Getting-Started)

        includes exactly what the header should look like (the Authorization header).

        First, note that this method is about to replace the old DscoAuth security scheme above.


        You will be provided a clientId and clientSecret.  You will use the clientId and clientSecret to make a call to the

        [Get Access Token API](#operation/getAccessToken) to mint an access token that will expire after an hour.  You will need to regularly

        make calls back to the [Get Access Token API](#operation/getAccessToken) to mint a new access token as they expire.


        Once you have generated a valid access token, which is a bearer token,

        you will need to pass the access token as an HTTP header on each API. Make sure you have a clientId and clientSecret for

        your account. If you don't have one, please email Rithum at support-dsco@rithum.com and title your email, "Create Client Credentials

        for Me". Make sure to include the name of your organization and your account information in the body of the email.

        The [Getting Started section](#section/Getting-Started)

        includes exactly what the access token when included as an HTTP header should look like (the Authorization header).


        Please see the [Get Access Token API](#operation/getAccessToken) for details of how the Oauth2 Client Credentials Workflow works.
